		description: "I think all of us are in a transition. Some are perhaps more obvious than others. You have the big physical ones like changing jobs or moving across country. And some are subtle and more reflective, like when you are ready to make a personal leap forward in how you will hold yourself accountable. \"First Jobzz\" helped me make the transition or I would rather say \"Kick Start\" to my professional career as a Software Professional. The modules for aptitude were coherent and covered nearly all topics. Special thanks to Pratap Nair sir for the motivation :-) The splendid team of FJ carved many \"Rough Stones\" into faceted gems !! Thanks First Jobzz. .",
