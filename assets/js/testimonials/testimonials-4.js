It was a typical time but all along institution was there along with my friends. It was mere patience that lead me here. Rejection from 5 companies one after the another shook my confidence. There were times where I felt hopeless but sometimes you can’t fight your luck. Got 2 OL in one day that was quite lucky so again u can’t fight your luck, so just be brave and make good decision. These guys are great and helped me a lot. So make atleast one choice correct. Cheers!!",

The teachers here are really amazing, they taught, they motivated, they helped me in introspecting myself. Before joining First Jobzz, I really did not know what my strengths, my weaknesses are, how to overcome my weaknesses. One unique feature of FJ is the attention paid to each and every individual not only inside classroom but outside it too. I learnt my weak points in mock PIs and I overcome it before campus with the help of faculty. The technical module helped me a lot to clear my technical interviews which is actually a great deal because it’s hard to revise all subjects of BE in such a short duration. Aptitude classes and tests helped me gain the speed of solving questions. Personal Interview and Group Discussion sessions gave me confidence to speak and understand the reason behind every question asked. Expert lectures motivated me a lot. Thank you so much First Jobzz team for helping me in my placements. It was a nice experience having you as mentors. These learning’s will help me lifelong. From FJ-47 Batch",
